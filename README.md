_Kernel Float_ is a header-only library for CUDA/HIP that simplifies working with vector types and reduced precision floating-point arithmetic in GPU code.


## Summary

CUDA/HIP natively offers several reduced precision floating-point types (`__half`, `__nv_bfloat16`, `__nv_fp8_e4m3`, `__nv_fp8_e5m2`)
and vector types (e.g., `__half2`, `__nv_fp8x4_e4m3`, `float3`).
However, working with these types is cumbersome:
mathematical operations require intrinsics (e.g., `__hadd2` performs addition for `__half2`),
type conversion is awkward (e.g., `__nv_cvt_halfraw2_to_fp8x2` converts float16 to float8),
and some functionality is missing (e.g., one cannot convert a `__half` to `__nv_bfloat16`).

_Kernel Float_ resolves this by offering a single data type `kernel_float::vec<T, N>` that stores `N` elements of type `T`.
Internally, the data is stored as a fixed-sized array of elements.
Operator overloading (like `+`, `*`, `&&`) has been implemented such that the most optimal intrinsic for the available types is selected automatically.
Many mathematical functions (like `log`, `exp`, `sin`) and common operations (such as `sum`, `range`, `for_each`) are also available.

Using Kernel Float, developers avoid the complexity of reduced precision floating-point types in CUDA and can focus on their applications.


## Features

In a nutshell, _Kernel Float_ offers the following features:

* Single type `vec<T, N>` that unifies all vector types.
* Operator overloading to simplify programming.
* Support for half (16 bit) floating-point arithmetic, with a fallback to single precision for unsupported operations.
* Support for quarter (8 bit) floating-point types.
* Easy integration as a single header file.
* Written for C++17.
* Compatible with NVCC (NVIDIA Compiler) and NVRTC (NVIDIA Runtime Compilation).
* Compatible with HIPCC (AMD HIP Compiler)


## Example

Check out the [examples](https://github.com/KernelTuner/kernel_float/tree/master/examples) directory for some examples.


Below shows a simple example of a CUDA kernel that adds a `constant` to the `input` array and writes the results to the `output` array.
Each thread processes two elements.
Notice how easy it would be to change the precision (for example, `double` to `half`) or the vector size (for example, 4 instead of 2 items per thread).


```cpp
#include "kernel_float.h"
namespace kf = kernel_float;

__global__ void kernel(const kf::vec<half, 2>* input, float constant, kf::vec<float, 2>* output) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    output[i] = input[i] + kf::cast<half>(constant);
}

```

Here is how the same kernel would look for CUDA without Kernel Float.

```cpp
__global__ void kernel(const __half* input, float constant, float* output) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    __half in0 = input[2 * i + 0];
    __half in1 = input[2 * i + 1];
    __half2 a = __halves2half2(in0, in1);
    float b = float(constant);
    __half c = __float2half(b);
    __half2 d = __half2half2(c);
    __half2 e = __hadd2(a, d);
    __half f = __low2half(e);
    __half g = __high2half(e);
    float out0 = __half2float(f);
    float out1 = __half2float(g);
    output[2 * i + 0] = out0;
    output[2 * i + 1] = out1;
}

```

Even though the second kernel looks a lot more complex, the PTX code generated by these two kernels is nearly identical.


## Installation

This is a header-only library. Copy the file `single_include/kernel_float.h` to your project and include it:

```cpp
#include "kernel_float.h"
```

Use the provided Makefile to generate this single-include header file if it is outdated:

```
make
```


## Documentation

See the [documentation](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_float/) for the [API reference](https://kerneltuner.github.io/kernel_float/api.html) of all functionality.
